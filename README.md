# Python for Data Science — Cognitive Class

This repository contains my Python learning materials and practice files from the **Python for Data Science course on Cognitive Class (IBM)**.

## 📚 About This Repository
I am currently learning Python as part of my journey into **Data Science and Healthcare Analytics**. In this repository, I will upload my Python scripts, exercises, and projects for each module of the course.

This repository documents my progress, understanding, and practical application of Python concepts relevant to data science.

## 🎯 Purpose
This repository serves to:
- Track my learning progress in Python  
- Practice coding consistently  
- Build a portfolio for future data science roles  
- Demonstrate my understanding of Python for Data Science
